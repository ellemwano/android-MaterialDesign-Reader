# MaterialDesign-Reader
Project #5 of the [Android Developer](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) Nanodegree by Udacity.

## Project Overview
Redesign a mock RSS feed reader app, featuring banner photos and headlines, to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## Why this Project
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## Learning objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
- Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
- Separate an interface into surfaces.
- Effectively use transitions and motion.

## Instructions
- Download a [zip file](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code) of the app.
- Read the user feedback:
  * Lyla says: _“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”_
  * Jay says: _“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."_
  * Kagure says: _“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”_
- Implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

## Project requirements
- **Required Behavior**
  * App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (`FloatingActionButton`, `AppBarLayout`, `SnackBar`, etc).
  * App uses `CoordinatorLayout` for the main Activity.
  * App theme extends from `AppCompat`.
  * App uses an `AppBar` and associated `Toolbars`.
  * App provides a `Floating Action Button` for the most common action(s).
  * App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
  * App has a consistent color theme defined in `styles.xml`. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.
  * App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
  * App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
  * App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
  * App conforms to common standards found in the [Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines](http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html).
  * App utilizes stable release versions of all libraries, Gradle, and Android Studio.
